        <div class="short-description-container"><p>There's one project I love doing when learning to program in new languages, and that's using simple Markov chains to create new and bizarre pieces of text. Granted, it's not the most complicated (or useful) project, but I never get tired of feeding a "dumb" Markov chain different types of text to see what gets spat out. </p>
        <p>For those of you unfamiliar with Markov chains (and how they can be used to generate text), I do my best to explain it simply in the writeup link above. But for now, enjoy these gems I got from training on different sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>"Me an' salt 'em because if there's jus' works the feeding racks were rosy in shame at all, and flung himself back, Smitty says I ain't. I don' like that?"</i> <b>- Of Mice and Men, George Steinbeck</b></li>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>Romeo save me, Juliet, you'll never have to feel This love story baby just say yes"  I'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  Oh, oh </i> <b>- Love Story, Taylor Swift</b></li>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>It!  Do the Hustle!   Do it!  Do it!  Do the Hustle!   Do the Hustle!    Do the Hustle!  Do it!</i> <b>- Do the Hustle, Van McCoy</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            I've seen some good Markov stuff out there that use tokenization and/or different methods of chopping up the training text to synthesize sentences that actually make sense, and that are correct in terms of syntax.... but aren't those examples above just adorable? To me it's kind of like when you space out while someone is talking and kind of drift in and out of the conversation. You <i>kind</i> of hear the words they're saying but it's really jumbled up in your head. Perhaps I should have just called this the "Inattentive Listener Simuator".
